# Tic Tac Toe - Python and Tkinter

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe project built using Python and its Tkinter library! This repository hosts a fun and interactive Tic Tac Toe game that challenges players to outwit their opponents in this classic board game. With the added feature of players entering their names, the game personalizes the experience and allows players to track their wins and losses.

## Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a popular two-player game where each player takes turns marking "X" or "O" on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to form a line of three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. This project implements the game logic and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, making it accessible and enjoyable for intermediate-level developers.

## Technologies Used

The Tic Tac Toe project harnesses the following technologies:

- **Python:** The core language that powers the game logic and controls the flow of the application.

- **Tkinter Library:** Used to create the GUI, enabling users to interact with the game through buttons and visuals.

## Features

Explore the exciting features available in this Tic Tac Toe game:

### Personalized Gaming Experience

Players enter their names at the beginning of the game, creating a personalized gaming experience. The game keeps track of wins and losses between users, allowing players to compete against each other multiple times and strive to become the ultimate Tic Tac Toe champion.

### Wins and Losses Tracking

The game keeps a record of each player's wins and losses throughout their gaming sessions. Players can view their current stats, motivating them to improve their strategies and challenge their opponents repeatedly.

### Intuitive User Interface

The game provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface. The board is visually presented, and players can click on the squares to place their marks. The interface dynamically updates to reflect the game state, providing clear feedback to players.

### Updated UI

As players interact with the game, the user interface dynamically updates to display the current player's turn, along with the updated wins and losses of both players. This feature ensures that players are always informed about the current game status.
